        The CSS Box Model

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design that defines how web browsers render HTML elements. It consists of four main components:

Content Box: This is the area that contains the element's actual content, such as text, images, or buttons.
Padding: This is the space between the content box and the border. It adds space around the content but is part of the element's overall width and height.
Border: This is the visual line around the element, defined by properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color.
Margin: This is the space outside the border of the element. It creates separation between the element and other elements on the page and is not part of the element's overall width and height.
